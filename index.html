                <h3>VAT Calculator</h3>
                <p>A VAT calculator is a software application that helps businesses and individuals calculate the value-added tax (VAT) on goods and services. VAT is a consumption tax that is levied on the sale of most goods and services in many countries around the world.
                    <br>The goal of this project is to develop a VAT calculator that is accurate, easy to use, and accessible to everyone. The calculator will support multiple VAT rates and will be able to calculate the VAT amount for both net and gross prices.
                    <br>The calculator will be implemented as a web application so that it can be used on any device with a web browser. The application will be developed using modern web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                <p>A todo list is a software application or website that allows users to create and manage lists of tasks. Todo lists are a popular way for people to stay organized and productive.

                    <br>The goal of this project is to develop a todo list application that is simple, easy to use, and effective. The application will allow users to create and manage multiple todo lists, add and edit tasks, set deadlines, and track progress.
                    
                    <br>The application will be implemented as a web application so that it can be used on any device with a web browser. The application will be developed using modern web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
